        <h2>Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
        <p>
          Although Nobel Prize-winning poet Tagore prioritized poetry, he also
          made notable contributions to literature as a dramatist, novelist,
          short story writer, and writer of nonfictional prose, especially
          essays, criticism, philosophical treatises, journals, memoirs, and
          letters. In addition, he expressed himself as musician, painter,
          actor-producer-director, educator, patriot, and social reformer.
          Referring to the variety and abundance of Tagore’s creative output,
          Buddhadeva Bose declared in An Acre of Green Grass, “It would be trite
          to call him versatile; to call him prolific very nearly funny.” Bose
          added, “The point is not that his writings run into a hundred thousand
          pages of print, covering every form and aspect of literature, though
          this matters: he is a source, a waterfall, flowing out in a hundred
          streams, a hundred rhythms, incessantly.”

          A man of prodigious literary and artistic accomplishments, Tagore
          played a leading role in Indian cultural renaissance and came to be
          recognized, along with Mohandas Gandhi, as one of the architects of
          modern India. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote in
          Discovery of India, “Tagore and Gandhi have undoubtedly been the two
          outstanding and dominating figures in the first half of the twentieth
          century. ... [Tagore’s] influence over the mind of India, and
          especially of successive rising generations has been tremendous. Not
          Bengali only, the language in which he himself wrote, but all the
          modern languages of India have been molded partly by his writings.
          More than any other Indian, he has helped to bring into harmony the
          ideals of the East and the West, and broadened the bases of Indian
          nationalism.”
